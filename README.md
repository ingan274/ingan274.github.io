Isabel Ngan's Portfolio featuring Full-Stacked Web Development work

I design for emotion. I believe cohesive and intuitive design systems are functional, usable, reliable, and most of all, breath feeling. Emotional design allows conversations with users that always end with a better iteration. So, why not design to fulfill a task and put a smile on our users faces?

As individuals, we own our story; as a collective, shared stories can be powerful. I relish listening to stories of individuals and companies that stem from passion and drive. I aim to always be open to learning new things, while acknowledging what I donâ€™t know.
