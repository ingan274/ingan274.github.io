## ARTIST TURNED DESIGNER
I design for emotion. I believe cohesive and intuitive design systems are functional, usable,  reliable, and most of all, breath feeling. Emotional design allows conversations with  users that always end with a better iteration. So, why not design to fulfill a task and put a smile on our users faces?

As individuals, we own our story; as a collective, shared stories can be powerful. I relish listening to stories of individuals and companies that stem from passion and drive. I aim to always be open to learning new things, while acknowledging what I donâ€™t know.

## WHY DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY?
My interest in Human-Computer Interaction comes from my interest in people. Though my studies into people and their experiences with visual concepts, I realized people perceptions changes the way they experiences the world. Through my work in Fashion and Advertising, I quickly realized how technology and their experience with technology motivates even the most human experiences: maintaining relationships to expressing our every triumphs and tribulations. And what captivates me most about people is the cyclical relationship we have with designing these technologies: we shape them, and they shape us.

## ABOUT ME
Since graduating from Northwestern University  with a degree in Art Theory and Practice and a Human-Centered Design certificate from the Segal Design Institute of the McCormick School of Engineering, I am actively exploring the ways data and creativity intersect and drive one another within design. 

Growing up in Southern California and navigating university, I was always attracted to experiences and opportunities with one common thread: Understanding the Human experience. I believe that there is a real kinship between the humans and design. Much of my work within Fashion and Advertising has informed my understanding of consumers and what experiences drive behavior. I believe that great design provokes thought, expands imagination, and changes our experience of the world.
