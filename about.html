                    I design for emotion. I believe cohesive and intuitive design systems are functional, usable,
                    reliable, and most of all, breath feeling. Emotional design allows conversations with users that
                    always end with a better iteration. So, why not design to fulfill a task and put a smile on our
                    users faces?

                    As individuals, we own our story; as a collective, shared stories can be powerful. I relish
                    listening to stories of individuals and companies that stem from passion and drive. I aim to
                    always be open to learning new things, while acknowledging what I don’t know.

                    ABOUT ME
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in Art Theory and Practice and a
                    Human-Centered Design certificate from the Segal Design Institute of the McCormick School of
                    Engineering, I am actively exploring the ways data and creativity intersect and drive one
                    another within design.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Growing up in Southern California and navigating university, I was always attracted to
                    experiences and opportunities with one common thread: Understanding the Human experience. I
                    believe that there is a real kinship between the humans and design. Much of my work within
                    Fashion and Advertising has informed my understanding of consumers and what experiences drive
                    behavior. I believe that great design provokes thought, expands imagination, and changes our
                    experience of the world.

                    I am currently in the process of applying for Human-Computer Interaction and Design related
                    Masters programs to further my education and training as a Designer.</h1>
